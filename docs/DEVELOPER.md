## Local installation

### Virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
python install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Unit tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```


## Update documentation table of contents

To update the table of contents in the documentation, you can use [the `doctoc` tool](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc).

First, install it:

```bash
npm install -g doctoc
```

Then, run it in the documentation folder:

```bash
doctoc docs/*
```


## Release process

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) approach to determine the next version number of the SDK.

Once you are ready to release a new version (e.g when all your changes are on the `main` branch), you should:

- Determine the next version number based on the changes made since the last release: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Update the [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) file with the new version number and the changes made since the last release.
  - Each release description must respect the same format as the previous ones.
- Commit the changes with a message like `chore(changelog) Prepare for release MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Browse to the [GitHub `Create and publish release` action](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/python-capi-sdk/actions/workflows/release.yml)
    - Click on `Run workflow` and fill the `Tag name` input with the new version number prefixed by a `v`: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
    - Tick the `Publish to PyPI` checkbox.
    - Click on `Run workflow` to trigger the release process.
